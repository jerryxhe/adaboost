# adaboost
A general AdaBoost implementation that can take any list of sklearn predictors and `boost` them

Almost all AdaBoost implementation uses stump trees, which is for better computational speed as explained by Freund and Shapire; however, we can also use AdaBoost to help us combine any list of models for better interpretability as well as pattern discovery. This python implemention aims to fill this gap and for any questions, or if you want to contribute please contact me at jerryxhe -at- icloud -dot- com
